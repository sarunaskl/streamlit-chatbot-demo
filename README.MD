To Do:

1. This homework should be in a separate public github repo. +
2. The repo should contain .gitignore and readme. +
3. UV config should be present in the repository, but not .venv +
4. Please build the same streamlit chatbot as in demo (streamlit-chatbot).
5. Ensure that your Github token is not exposed. (.env should be pushed). .. "Typo, .env should not be pushed" +

Please try making the following changes (you can use chatgpt for that):
    1. Update the chatbot, that it always answer in Lithuanian. (use instruction/prompt engineering)
    2. (optional) Update the streamlit chatbot so that it allows you to upload a file.

Advanced, optional: Integrate RAG, langchain with this streamlit chatbot.
